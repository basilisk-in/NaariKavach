# NaariKavach
*Your Safety, Our Priority~*

---

## Project Idea
NaariKavach is a women safety system leveraging CCTV feeds/footage, aiming to detect potential threats through real-time activity monitoring and classification, including distress signals made by individuals. Suspicious behaviour is analyzed using ML Techniques and on identification, immediate alerts are triggered to authorities via a centralized map interface, enabling faster and more accurate responses. The system also supports scenario simulation and route forensics, aiding in both proactive and post-incident analysis. This integrated approach enhances public safety through intelligent surveillance and rapid coordination.

We plan to integrate a website based centralized dashboard for police monitoring and additionally also support app based integration with the option for users to register and report distress calls or monitoring requests to the competent authorities, additionally the app will also contain roles for the authorities(police) where they can see the map for nearby distress calls, get alerts and acknowledge/dispatch a request and so on.
